# AWS-Glue-ETL-Pipelines

Data Transformation and ETL Pipelines with AWS Glue

Corporations the world over manage large datasets stored in AWS S3. To derive insights and generate reports, they need to automate their ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for better efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. The major goal is to streamline data transformation and load into a destination storage system, ensuring the data is ready for analysis.This automation enhances their data processing capabilities, reduces manual effort, and improves data-driven decision-making.

# Activity Guide: Setting Up and Running an AWS Glue ETL Job

1. Set Up an AWS Glue Job (AWS Glue)  
Create a Glue Job:
Access the AWS Glue Console and create a new Glue job (Visual ETL or use a Notebook).
Define Source and Target:
Specify the source S3 bucket and folder containing the raw data.
Define the target S3 bucket and folder for the transformed data.
Set Job Parameters:
Configure job runtime settings like allocated DPUs, timeout duration, and retries.

2. Transform Data (AWS Glue Studio)
Create a Data Transformation Script:
Use Glue Studio's visual interface or write a Python script for data transformations.
Apply operations such as filtering, mapping, and aggregations as needed.
Test the Transformation:
Validate the script by running small-scale test jobs to ensure transformations are accurate.
Save the Script:
Store the final ETL script in the Glue repository for future use.

3. Run the ETL Job (AWS Glue)
Launch the Job:
Start the Glue job from the Glue Console.
Monitor job progress and logs in real-time using CloudWatch.
Verify Data Movement:
Confirm that the processed data has moved from the source S3 bucket to the target S3 bucket.
Check the accuracy of transformed data in the target location.

4. Automate the ETL Workflow (AWS Glue, AWS Lambda)
Schedule the Glue Job:
Use AWS Glue triggers to schedule the job for periodic execution.
Integrate with Lambda:
Use AWS Lambda to invoke the Glue job based on specific events, such as new data uploads to the source S3 bucket.

5. Optimize and Monitor the Job (AWS Glue, CloudWatch)
Optimize Job Performance:
Tune DPU allocation and parallelism settings for efficient execution.
Set Up Monitoring:
Use CloudWatch to track metrics like job duration, error rates, and resource usage.
Configure alerts for job failures or performance anomalies.
